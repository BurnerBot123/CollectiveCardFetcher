At start of turn, each player first draws 1 card and gains 1 EXP.\n\nDuring the first phase, a player is assigned initiative, which alternates between players each turn. Players simultaneously play their cards and activate unit abilities (actives). Their decisions don't happen immediately, but go on a stack where they wait to be resolved, until both players finished making their choices. Then, starting with the player with initiative, all cards/abilities are resolved in the order they were selected in. After all of the effects of the cards/abilities of the initiative player resolves, then all of the non-initiative player's actions resolve. That ends the first phase.\n\nDuring the second phase, players again make simultaneous decisions that don't take effect until both have confirmed their choices. Attackers are selected first. After those choices are locked in, then defenders are selected. After defenders are locked in, combat happens. The initiative player's attackers deal their atk to their respective blockers' hp, or to the opponent's hp if unblocked. The attack value of a unit is dealt cumulatively to each defender, not the same amount to each. If an 1/2 attacker is blocked with two 1/1s, only one of the 1/1s will die. The order in which you select blocks is the order in which units block. This can lead to situations where a 1/2 is blocked with a vanilla 0/3 and a 1/1 deadly, and the deadly unit will kill the 1/2 without taking damage, because it was selected it to block second.")

When you build a new deck, you do so under a hero of your choice, with that deck being bound to the hero and unable to be played with any other.  Heroes aren\'t actual units or cards, but act as a reward system through which you can receive a free unit on board, a spell in hand, or a passive ability that lasts for the duration of the game. Each hero (of which the game currently has four, with more planned) has 4 different rewards specific to them, provided sequentially when they "level up". Leveling up happens as certain EXP thresholds are reached within each match, which are reset once the match concludes, with the exact thresholds differing for each hero. EXP is attainable through three ways: One, at the beginning of each turn, each player gains 1 EXP. Two, each hero has a unique passive ability that triggers once per turn, and providing you with a set amount of EXP if you meet that condition. Three, certain cards in game possess the ability Exemplar, which provides EXP equal to the amount of damage that they deal whenever they do.\n\nTake the hero Heldim as an example. He has a passive ability that provides 2 EXP whenever you attack with only one unit. When he reaches 4 total EXP, his level 1 reward is unlocked, which is a 2/2 flier named Cassiel that is played on the board for you for free, at the end of the turn you reach the reward threshold. His level 2, which requires 7 additional EXP to reach, resurrects Cassiel if she is dead and gives her +2/+2 permanently. His further rewards again resurrect Cassiel and provides her additional buffs.\n\nThe nature of heroes, their passives, and their rewards shapes the playstyle of the decks built under them, while allowing enough flexibility that multiple archetypes can be built under one hero. The aforementioned Heldim, for example, lends himself to aggro and aggressive midrange decks currently. Vriktik, on the other hand, has a passive that triggers on enemy unit death and gives rewards that are good at removing/stalling enemy units, so its decks tend to lean towards control. Building your deck to best take advantage of a given heroâ€™s traits is a pillar of Collectiveâ€™s gameplay, and enables a further layer of variety beyond the affinity system.')
